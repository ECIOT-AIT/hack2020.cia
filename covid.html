            WHAT ABOUT COVID19?
        </h1>
        <p>
            As COVID-19 becomes a matter of global concern, we’re taking some proactive measures to help minimise the
            chances of
            spread of the coronavirus. The safety of our customers, employees, delivery partners and restaurant partners
            has always
            been a matter of top priority for us - now more than ever before.
            <br>
            In the wake of COVID-19, here's a quick update on some of the steps we've taken to maintain a safe and
            healthy
            environment for all:
            Our organizers are continually being trained in best practices of respiratory hygiene, proper method &
            frequency of
            washing hands as well as identification of associated symptoms.
            Should a delivery partner notice any associated symptoms, they’ve been asked to immediately reach out to us
            and consult
            a medical professional. We are providing them with free medical consultation through our partners in such
            cases.
            Our Organizers have also been advised to self-quarantine themselves for the recommended period upon
            noticing any
            symptoms. To ensure their financial safety, we are committed to supporting them financially in such
            situations.
            We are also in touch with our restaurant partners to ensure they’re aware of the best hygiene practices
            while handling
            and packaging food items.
            Additionally, you may request the delivery partner to leave your package by the door (in case of online
            payment), in
            case you are feeling unwell or prefer so.
            We’re confident that with the right practices, we can help curb the spread of COVID-19. In the meantime,
            should you have
            any concerns about the matter, please reach out to our customer support team at support@swiggy.in or raise a
            complaint
            through the Swiggy app .
